Welcome to Wand's documentation!
================================

Wand is a new programming language that attempts to take the best features of
modern languages such as D, Java and Vala and implement them in a reliable and
simple to use package.

A major goal of Wand is that the compiler should never become an obstacle to
application design and development. Wand's language design attempts to make 
good code easier to write, and prefers explicit definition and verboseness
wherever it makes code easier to understand.
